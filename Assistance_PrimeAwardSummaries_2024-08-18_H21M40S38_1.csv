DR IS DEFINED BY THE PROLIFERATIVE EXPANSION OF BILIARY EPITHELIAL CELLS (BECS) AND CAN INVOLVE CONTEXT-DEPENDENT LINEAGE CONVERSION BETWEEN MATURE HEPATOCYTES AND BECS THAT CONTRIBUTES TO TISSUE REGENERATION. THE GENETIC REGULATION OF DR REMAINS POORLY UNDERSTOOD, INCLUDING HOW BECS BALANCE PROLIFERATION AND PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY. SOX9 IS A TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR REQUIRED FOR STEM/PROGENITOR CELL FUNCTION IN A NUMBER OF EPITHELIAL TISSUES AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ESTABLISH CELLULAR IDENTITY THROUGH GENOME-WIDE EFFECTS ON THE CHROMATIN LANDSCAPE. IN THE LIVER, SOX9 IS REQUIRED FOR TIMING OF BEC SPECIFICATION IN DEVELOPMENT AND IS BROADLY EXPRESSED IN ADULT BECS. OUR LAB RECENTLY USED A SOX9EGFP TRANSGENE TO STUDY BEC HETEROGENEITY AND SHOWED THAT SOX9 IS EXPRESSED AT DISTINCT LEVELS IN SUBPOPULATIONS OF BECS AND PERIBILIARY HYBRID HEPATOCYTES (HYBHEPS) DURING HOMEOSTASIS AND CHOLESTASIS. NEW FINDINGS FROM OUR LAB ALSO DEMONSTRATE ABNORMALITIES IN BECS OF ADULT SOX9 KNOCKOUT MICE. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT SOX9 FUNCTIONS AS A MASTER REGULATOR OF DR, BY INHIBITING PROLIFERATION AND PROMOTING BEC IDENTITY. THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS WILL TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS: AIM 1A WILL DETERMINE THE ROLE OF SOX9 IN DAMAGE INDUCED BEC PROLIFERATION, THROUGH THE USE OF THE SOX9EGFP ALLELE AND (1) COMBINED BEC/HEPATOCYTE OR (2) BEC-SPECIFIC SOX9 KNOCKOUT MOUSE MODELS. AIM 1B WILL DETERMINE THE ROLE OF SOX9 IN BI-DIRECTIONAL BEC-TO-HEPATOCYTE PLASTICITY, THROUGH COMPLEMENTARY IN VIVO LINEAGE TRACING AND IN VITRO ORGANOID ASSAYS. AIM 2A WILL MAP THE CHROMATIN REGULATORY LANDSCAPE OF DR, BY INTEGRATING TRANSCRIPTOMICS AND CHROMATIN ASSAYS IN BEC SUBPOPULATIONS DURING LIVER INJURY. AIM 2B WILL DETERMINE THE GENOMIC REGULATORY IMPACT OF SOX9 IN DR BY APPLYING SINGLE CELL MULTI-OMICS TO BEC- SPECIFIC SOX9 KNOCKOUT MOUSE MODELS. THE DATA GENERATED IN THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE FUNDAMENTAL MECHANISTIC INSIGHT INTO GENETIC REGULATION OF DR AND IDENTIFY REGULATORY NODES FOR THERAPEUTIC TARGETING TO ENHANCE REGENERATION IN END STAGE LIVER DISEASE.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,O,PRIVATE INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01DK132653_7529/,2024-05-20

RECENT ADVANCES IN ADULT CANCERS SUCH AS CHECKPOINT BLOCKADE AND TARGETED SMALL MOLECULES HAVE MADE LITTLE IMPACT IN CHILDHOOD DISEASE. ENGINEERED T-CELL THERAPIES CAN ACHIEVE DURABLE RESPONSES IN REFRACTORY LYMPHOID CANCERS WITHOUT LONG-TERM TOXICITY. THESE ARE PRECISELY THE CHARACTERISTICS REQUIRED FOR NEW TREATMENTS FOR PEDIATRIC SOLID CANCERS. IN CONTRAST TO HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES, SOLID CANCERS ARE CHALLENGING DUE TO A LACK OF TARGETS, TUMOR HETEROGENEITY, AND HOSTILE TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT (TME). WE POSIT THAT THROUGH ADVANCED CELLULAR ENGINEERING WE CAN OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES. OUR VISION IS THAT ENGINEERED T-CELL THERAPY FOR CHILDHOOD SOLID CANCERS WILL BECOME ROUTINE WITHIN A DECADE. OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT COUPLING OF ADVANCED CELLULAR ENGINEERING ALONG WITH PROGRESSIVE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT IS THE FASTEST ROUTE TO DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE T-CELL THERAPIES FOR PEDIATRIC SOLID TUMORS. IN NEXTGEN, WE COMBINE DETAILED STUDIES OF PRIMARY TUMORS TO DISCOVER NEW TARGETS AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE TME SUBVERTS T- CELL FUNCTION. THIS, ALONG WITH A CLOSELY COUPLED CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WILL GUIDE THE PROGRESSIVE ENGINEERING OF T-CELLS TO RESULT IN TRANSFORMATIVE THERAPIES. NEXTGEN IS COMPOSED OF 6 INTER-CONNECTED WORK-PACKAGES (WPS) WITH WORK INITIALLY FOCUSED ON PEDIATRIC SARCOMAS AND BRAIN TUMORS. AIMS: WP1: TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE TARGETS FOR ENGINEERED T-CELLS.

ELIAS NATIONAL PARK AND PRESERVE (WRST). ECOLOGICALLY, THEY REPRESENT A VITAL SOURCE OF ENERGY AND MARINE-DERIVED NUTRIENTS TO PARK ECOSYSTEMS. CULTURALLY, THEY ARE CENTRAL TO THE TRADITIONS AND SUBSISTENCE PRACTICES OF INDIGENOUS AHTNA AND OTHER RURAL RESIDENTS AFFILIATED WITH THE CR DRAINAGE (FEDERAL SUBSISTENCE USERS) AND ARE VALUED BY MANY ALASKA RESIDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN SEVERAL STATE-MANAGED (ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME, ADF&G) FISHERIES THAT HARVEST CR SOCKEYE. SOCKEYE SALMON OF THE CR ALSO REPRESENT A CRUCIAL ECONOMIC RESOURCE TO THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN CR FISHERIES AND TO THE REGION, WITH SOCKEYE SALMON HARVESTED IN THE COMMERCIAL GILLNET DRIFT FISHERY (WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 84% OF THE ANNUAL CR SOCKEYE SALMON HARVEST) VALUED UP TO $40M ANNUALLY. BY FAR, SOCKEYE SALMON IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT SUBSISTENCE RESOURCE FOR MANY OF THE RURAL ALASKA COMMUNITIES AFFILIATED WITH WRST, AS MEASURED BY MEAN ANNUAL HARVEST WEIGHT PER HOUSEHOLD.FISHERIES THAT HARVEST CR SOCKEYE SALMON ARE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE SPECIFIED GOALS FOR DRAINAGE-WIDE ESCAPEMENT (DEFINED AS THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF SPAWNING SOCKEYE SALMON), WITH ESCAPEMENT GOALS SPECIFIED WITHIN RANGES NECESSARY FOR CONSERVING AND SUSTAINING LONG-TERM SALMON PRODUCTION AND MAINTAINING NORMAL ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING. IN ADDITION TO ESCAPEMENT AMOUNT, ESCAPEMENT IS TO BE MANAGED IN A MANNER THAT MAINTAINS GENETIC AND PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS OF CR SOCKEYE SALMON STOCKS BY ASSURING APPROPRIATE GEOGRAPHIC AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF SPAWNERS THROUGHOUT THE CR DRAINAGE, INCLUDING THE SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF SOCKEYE SALMON DESTINED FOR SPAWNING GROUNDS IN WRST. THESE STOCK CHARACTERISTICS, AS WELL AS SIZE RANGE, SEX RATIO, AND OTHER POPULATION ATTRIBUTES ARE ENCOMPASSED BY THE CONCEPT OF ESCAPEMENT QUALITY.IN 2018 AND AGAIN IN 2020, UNEXPECTEDLY LOW NUMBERS OF SOCKEYE SALMON RETURNED TO THE CR DRAINAGE SYSTEM FROM THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT, WITH DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCES FOR CR FISHERIES AND STAKEHOLDERS. THESE INCLUDED THE UNPRECEDENTED CLOSURE OF THE COMMERCIAL FISHERY FOR 41 CONSECUTIVE DAYS IN 2018 AND ONLY FISHING SEVEN PERIODS IN 2020; THE FIRST-EVER CLOSURE OF THE STATE SUBSISTENCE FISHERY IN 2018; AND EXPANDED CLOSURES OF THE PERSONAL USE FISHERY IN 2018 AND 2020. IN 2018, CONCERN AMONG FEDERAL SUBSISTENCE USERS ABOUT THE LOW SOCKEYE SALMON RETURN AND IMPACTS OF STATE-MANAGED FISHERIES ON SOCKEYE SALMON STOCKS RESULTED IN UNPRECEDENTED WRITTEN REQUESTS THAT THE WRST SUPERINTENDENT ISSUE EMERGENCY SPECIAL ACTIONS CLOSING ONE OR MORE STATE FISHERIES PURSUANT TO HIS DELEGATED AUTHORITY FROM THE FEDERAL SUBSISTENCE BOARD.IN ADDITION TO RECENT RELATIVELY LOW NUMBERS OF RETURNING CR SOCKEYE SALMON, THERE HAS BEEN A LONG-TERM DECLINE IN BODY SIZE OF RETURNING CR SOCKEYE SALMON, WHICH MAY BE AN IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO RECENT LOW ESCAPEMENT. SMALLER FISH MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER EN-ROUTE (PRE-SPAWNING) MORTALITY, POTENTIALLY DRIVEN BY IMPACTS OF CHANGING MARINE CONDITIONS (WARMING AND COMPETITION) ON HEALTH PARAMETERS AND THE CAPACITY OF SOCKEYE SALMON TO RESPOND TO CHANGING RIVERINE CONDITIONS (FLOW AND TEMPERATURE REGIMES).IN THIS CONTEXT, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES IN THE GULF OF ALASKA AND THE CR WATERSHED MAY IMPACT SPAWNING MIGRATION SUCCESS BY SOCKEYE SALMON UNDER FUTURE ECOLOGICAL SCENARIOS. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO INTEGRATE PRIOR AND ONGOING RADIO-TELEMETRY DATA ON CR SOCKEYE SPAWNING MIGRATION WITH SEVERAL LONG-TERM ADF&G DATA SETS TO DEVELOP FORECASTING MODELS FOR SOCKEYE THAT WOULD INCORPORATE NEW INFORMATION FROM A RECENTLY AVAILABLE HYDROLOGICAL MODEL DEVELOPED BY USGS. THIS INFORMATION WILL BE USED TO EVALUATE THE CONDITION OF CR SOCKEYE STOCKS AS INDICATED BY MIGRATORY SUCCESS AND INCIDENCE OF EN ROUTE OR PRE-SPAWN MORTALITY.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,M,NONPROFIT WITH 501C3 IRS STATUS (OTHER THAN AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION),2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_P22AC01027_1443/,2023-07-17

A PRIMARY AIM OF TREATMENT IS IMPROVING SPEECH INTELLIGIBILITY. CURRENT PEDIATRIC DYSARTHRIA INTERVENTIONS FOCUS ON CLEAR AND/OR LOUD SPEECH, PHONATION, SPEECH RATE, OR SOME COMBINATION OF THESE. WHILE SEVERAL INTERVENTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN INTELLIGIBILITY GAINS, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL VARIABILITY IN OUTCOMES. ADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT INTELLIGIBILITY CAN BE MAXIMIZED FOR ALL CHILDREN. LABORATORY STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY IDENTIFIED THE ARTICULATORY SYSTEM AS THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO INTELLIGIBILITY DEFICITS IN DYSARTHRIA, IMPLICATING VARIABLES SUCH AS VOWEL SPACE AND F2 SLOPE. HOWEVER, THESE MEASURES ARE NOT CLINICALLY ACCESSIBLE, NOR DO THEY TRANSLATE TO SPECIFIC TREATMENT TARGETS. GIVEN THE PRIMACY OF THE ARTICULATORY SYSTEM TO INTELLIGIBILITY AND DEVELOPMENTAL MALLEABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF SPEECH IN CHILDREN, THERE IS A NEED FOR SENSITIVE METRICS TO QUANTIFY ARTICULATION USING CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL UNITS (I.E., SPEECH SOUNDS). SUCH METRICS WOULD ENABLE US TO UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFERENT SPEECH SOUNDS CONTRIBUTE TO INTELLIGIBILITY AND WOULD LEAD TO ADVANCEMENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA-DRIVEN INTERVENTIONS FOR IMPROVING INTELLIGIBILITY IN CHILDREN WITH DYSARTHRIA, COMPLEMENTING EXISTING THERAPIES. OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP A CLINICAL TOOL THAT YIELDS OBJECTIVE, CONTINUOUS, AND AUTOMATIC QUANTIFICATION OF SPEECH SOUND ARTICULATION FROM CONNECTED SPEECH IN CHILDREN; WE WILL USE THIS TOOL TO QUANTIFY THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF INDIVIDUAL PHONEMES TO INTELLIGIBILITY. TO DO THIS, WE WILL USE STATE-OF-THE ART SPEECH ANALYTICS INVOLVING MACHINE LEARNING FOR ACOUSTIC MODELING, AND CLINICAL RESEARCH IN SPEECH PATHOLOGY TO REFINE AND VALIDATE ALGORITHMS THAT SPECIFY A PHONEME LOG-LIKELIHOOD RATIO (PLLR) FOR EACH PHONEME IN ENGLISH. WE WILL USE THE PLLR TO CREATE GROWTH CURVES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHONEME ARTICULATION BASED ON DATA FROM 750 TYPICALLY DEVELOPING CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 2 ½ AND 10 YEARS, AND TO CHARACTERIZE THE CONTRIBUTION OF INDIVIDUAL PHONEMES TO INTELLIGIBILITY BY AGE IN THESE CHILDREN. WE WILL THEN EXAMINE 700 LONGITUDINAL SPEECH SAMPLES FROM CHILDREN WITH DYSARTHRIA BETWEEN THE AGES OF 2 ½ AND 10 YEARS, AND IDENTIFY HOW THEY DIFFER FROM TYPICAL CHILDREN IN PHONEME DEVELOPMENT AND HOW SPEECH SOUND ARTICULATION CONTRIBUTES TO INTELLIGIBILITY. THE OUTCOME OF THIS RESEARCH IS AN ALGORITHM THAT CAN QUANTIFY PHONEME ARTICULATION IN CHILDREN, INDICATING A CHILD’S PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO NORMS FOR EACH PHONEME. RESULTS WILL SPECIFY THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF INDIVIDUAL PHONEMES TO INTELLIGIBILITY, AND HOW THIS CHANGES DEVELOPMENTALLY AND IN THE CONTEXT OF DYSARTHRIA. A FINE-GRAINED UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF DYSARTHRIA ON PHONEME DEVELOPMENT AND SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO INTELLIGIBILITY HAS NEVER BEFORE BEEN FEASIBLE AND WILL HAVE DIRECT CLINICAL AND THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS. RESULTS WILL LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR NEW ASSESSMENTS AND TREATMENTS FOR IMPROVING INTELLIGIBILITY IN CHILDHOOD DYSARTHRIA.",NON,NOT RECOVERY ACT,H,PUBLIC/STATE CONTROLLED INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION,2,NON-AGGREGATE RECORD,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_R01DC019645_7529/,2024-04-19
